## Introduction

Stock Price Modelling is a very well celebrated as well as challenging job for the people in industry as well as in academics. There are several approaches. In this paper we will implement stochastic modelling based on mainly a dataset of `Bank NIFTY` starting from 1st Jan,2020 and in each interval of 1 min. We have 5000 observations there. For the entire study, we will try to model `Open Price` throughout.
